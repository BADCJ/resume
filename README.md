## Description

Experienced in crafting robust web applications, I am a Full-Stack Developer with a strong focus on backend development using Node.js. Proficient in both traditional and modern frameworks, I specialize in leveraging the power of React.js for dynamic and interactive user interfaces, coupled with TypeScript for enhanced type safety and maintainability.

On the backend, I am well-versed in utilizing Express.js for building RESTful APIs and Nest.js for creating scalable and modular applications following best practices and design patterns. My expertise extends to utilizing Koa.js for more lightweight and minimalist web frameworks, providing tailored solutions based on project requirements.

With a deep understanding of cloud computing, I utilize AWS services to deploy, manage, and scale applications efficiently, ensuring high availability and reliability. Additionally, I have experience working with Kafka and RabbitMQ for building microservices architectures, enabling seamless communication and data processing between distributed systems.

Furthermore, I employ Redis for caching strategies, optimizing application performance and response times. Proficient in Python, I incorporate it into backend services when additional functionalities or integrations are required, ensuring versatility and adaptability in project implementations.

Combining technical expertise with a passion for innovation, I am committed to delivering high-quality solutions that meet and exceed client expectations. With a proven track record of successful project deliveries, I thrive in dynamic environments where collaboration and continuous learning are valued.
